‚≠êÔ∏è A LARGE LANGUAGE MODEL TOOK ME ON VACATION
Imagine handing over your vacation planning to an AI. Sounds crazy, right? That's exactly what Jorrik did for his trip to Porto in Portugal. ChatGPT picked everything from restaurants to the sightseeing spots. But this trip taught Jorrik more than just how to order pastel de nata in Portuguese.
In this talk, you'll dive into different parallels between prompting engineering AI for travel tips and using it for coding and problem-solving. You'll learn why context is king in AI interactions and ways to provide it effectively. Jorrik will walk you through real examples from my AI-planned adventure, showing how each interaction unlocked new insights into advanced prompting techniques. Plus, he will introduce you to "Indirect Conversation" a new method he describes as "pushing AI's creative boundaries".
Integrating AI in applications is now everywhere to be found. And creating web applications, prompt engineering is set to become a crucial skill in our developers toolkit. The techniques you'll learn aren't just for planning vacations. They're the building blocks for creating smarter, more intuitive AI-powered tools. Whether you're designing chatbots, implementing AI-assisted search, or build the next-gen AI-driven web app, mastering these prompting skills will give you a significant benefit in creating a seamless user experience.
By the end of this session, you'll walk away with practical skills to supercharge your AI interactions, whether you're planning your next vacation or tackling complex coding challenges. You'll gain a fresh perspective on AI's capabilities and limitations, and you'll be equipped with strategies to get more innovative, useful responses from AI tools. Get ready for a session that's a bit of fun, part travelogue, mainly tech talk, and entirely eye-opening!

‚≠êÔ∏è IMPROVING RETRIEVAL Q&A CONTEXTUALIZATION PROMPTS (USING TEXTGRAD)
We showcase the importance of good query contextualization in document retrieval Q&A scenarios with various industry examples. We present approaches to improve contextualization by prompt engineering with TextGrad and show how crucial these improvements are for delivering industry-grade chatbot solutions and customer satisfaction.
Background: When performing document retrieval in a Q&A/chatbot scenario, just using the last Q&A message, namely the current human inquiry, as a target might not yield good results. Often the context needed for retrieving relevant documents is spread out over several previous messages. Query contextualization helps by transforming a message history into a singular retrieval query including the relevant context. Main threats to the quality of the retrieval are missing context, a direct answer to the question, and follow-up questions back to the user in the contextualized query. These threats can be contained by a good choice of the contextualization model and a well-designed system prompt.

‚≠êÔ∏è MULTI-AGENT SYSTEMS FOR ADVANCED PROMPT CLARIFICATION
The concept of optimizing prompt engineering through a multi-agent model involves dividing the task of understanding and refining user inputs into distinct roles. When a user provides an incomplete or unclear prompt, the first agent acts as an interactive mediator, engaging in a dialogue to elicit further details or clarify the intent behind the prompt. By refining and enhancing the initial query through iterative questioning or contextualization, the first agent ensures that the final prompt accurately represents the user's true needs. Once the prompt has been clarified, it is passed to the second agent, which is responsible for processing the refined input and generating the desired output. This system allows for more effective handling of vague or ambiguous prompts, improving overall response quality and user satisfaction by ensuring that the core question or task is fully understood before the model attempts to provide a solution.

‚≠êÔ∏è NAVIGATING PROMPT QUALITY IN ENTERPRISE: CHAOS CONTROL GUIDE
What if you have a few hundreds developers building their AI-based features all across a huge user-facing product? Sounds exciting but also a bit troubling: how is it possible to move fast without compromising security and quality standards of an enterprise?
During the past year, we‚Äôve built a whole infrastructure for LLM-oriented development in Wix. As the industry was exploding with new models and techniques, this infrastructure grew to include a wide range of tools to make developer experience with AI really smooth. But then we‚Äôve noticed something else: the easier it was to work with LLMs, the more difficult it was to make sure that the quality of LLM-based features stays high. That was the moment when we had to make a leap from AI democratisation to AI standardisation.
Building a whole infrastructure of prompt QA tools and arranging prompt engineering flows gave me some new insights about bringing AI to enterprise while ensuring a high standard of LLM feature implementation.
In this talk, I‚Äôll take you through the AI Standartisation journey we took and share some practical ideas of improving prompt engineering standards across a big organisation. We‚Äôll touch both technical solutions and educational approaches that can help in bringing enterprise prompt engineering standards to a higher level.

‚≠êÔ∏è MODEL-BASED INPUT VALIDATION FOR PREVENTING PROMPT INJECTION ATTACKS
As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into various applications, the threat of prompt injection attacks has emerged as a significant security concern. This presentation introduces a novel model-based input validation approach to mitigate these attacks in LLM-integrated applications.
We present a meta-prompt methodology that acts as an intermediate validator, examining user inputs before they reach the LLM. Our approach builds on established input validation techniques, drawing parallels with traditional security measures like SQL injection prevention.
Throughout the presentation, we will discuss the challenges of input validation in LLM contexts and explore how our model-based approach provides a more flexible and adaptive solution. We'll share preliminary results from evaluations against established prompt injection datasets, highlighting the effectiveness of our methodology in detecting and mitigating various types of injection attempts.
Join us for an insightful exploration of this innovative approach to enhancing the security of LLM applications through advanced prompt engineering techniques, and learn how to implement robust input validation mechanisms to safeguard your AI-driven systems.

‚≠êÔ∏è WORDS AS WEAPONS: THE DARK ARTS OF PROMPT ENGINEERING
With a "Co-pilot for everything," our interaction with technology and daily tasks is evolving. Organizations are increasingly integrating LLMs into their applications, enhancing features like search tools, chatbots, and internal information systems.
Chances are, you're already working with Generative AI or will be soon. But are you aware of the risks before diving into use cases or development? Curiosity drives us to explore limits, which can lead to finding ways around "Guard Rails." These guard rails prevent misuse, like asking ChatGPT how to build a bomb. But what if clever wordplay confuses LLMs into bypassing these safeguards?
In "The dark arts of Prompt Engineering," we'll explore Prompt Injections. We'll cover what Guard Rails are, how they function, and how to circumvent them using Prompt Injections‚Äîpurely for educational purposes. Understanding these risks is crucial for knowing where to implement safeguards or reconsider actions. This session goes beyond tech details. It‚Äôs about real-life impacts. You'll see examples that will make you rethink AI's role in our lives. We'll also discuss the ethical aspect‚Äîhow to use AI responsibly and safely. Plus, learn a fun trick: hide some "words as weapons" in your CV to trick recruiters!
As AI is here to stay, let's get secure and join this session!
