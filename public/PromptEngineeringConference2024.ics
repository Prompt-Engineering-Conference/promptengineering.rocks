DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Jorrik Klijnsma\n\nImagine handing over your vacation
  planning to an AI. Sounds crazy\, right? That's exactly what Jorrik did 
 for his trip to Porto in Portugal. ChatGPT picked everything from restaur
 ants to the sightseeing spots. But this trip taught Jorrik more than just
  how to order pastel de nata in Portuguese.\n\nIn this talk\, you'll dive
  into different parallels between prompting engineering AI for travel tip
 s and using it for coding and problem-solving. You'll learn why context i
 s king in AI interactions and ways to provide it effectively. Jorrik will
  walk you through real examples from my AI-planned adventure\, showing ho
 w each interaction unlocked new insights into advanced prompting techniqu
 es. Plus\, he will introduce you to "Indirect Conversation" a new method 
 he describes as "pushing AI's creative boundaries".\n\nIntegrating AI in 
 applications is now everywhere to be found. And creating web applications
 \, prompt engineering is set to become a crucial skill in our developers 
 toolkit. The techniques you'll learn aren't just for planning vacations. 
 They're the building blocks for creating smarter\, more intuitive AI-powe
 red tools. Whether you're designing chatbots\, implementing AI-assisted s
 earch\, or build the next-gen AI-driven web app\, mastering these prompti
 ng skills will give you a significant benefit in creating a seamless user
  experience.\n\nBy the end of this session\, you'll walk away with practi
 cal skills to supercharge your AI interactions\, whether you're planning 
 your next vacation or tackling complex coding challenges. You'll gain a f
 resh perspective on AI's capabilities and limitations\, and you'll be equ
 ipped with strategies to get more innovative\, useful responses from AI t
 ools. Get ready for a session that's a bit of fun\, part travelogue\, mai
 nly tech talk\, and entirely eye-opening!

DESCRIPTION:Speakers: Johannes Kuhn\, Max Schattauer\n\nWe showcase the im
 portance of good query contextualization in document retrieval Q&A scenar
 ios with various industry examples. We present approaches to improve cont
 extualization by prompt engineering with TextGrad and show how crucial th
 ese improvements are for delivering industry-grade chatbot solutions and 
 customer satisfaction.\n\nBackground: When performing document retrieval 
 in a Q&A/chatbot scenario\, just using the last Q&A message\, namely the 
 current human inquiry\, as a target might not yield good results. Often t
 he context needed for retrieving relevant documents is spread out over se
 veral previous messages. Query contextualization helps by transforming a 
 message history into a singular retrieval query including the relevant co
 ntext. Main threats to the quality of the retrieval are missing context\,
  a direct answer to the question\, and follow-up questions back to the us
 er in the contextualized query. These threats can be contained by a good 
 choice of the contextualization model and a well-designed system prompt.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Koushik Sundar\n\nThe concept of optimizing prompt en
 gineering through a multi-agent model involves dividing the task of under
 standing and refining user inputs into distinct roles. When a user provid
 es an incomplete or unclear prompt\, the first agent acts as an interacti
 ve mediator\, engaging in a dialogue to elicit further details or clarify
  the intent behind the prompt. By refining and enhancing the initial quer
 y through iterative questioning or contextualization\, the first agent en
 sures that the final prompt accurately represents the user's true needs. 
 Once the prompt has been clarified\, it is passed to the second agent\, w
 hich is responsible for processing the refined input and generating the d
 esired output. This system allows for more effective handling of vague or
  ambiguous prompts\, improving overall response quality and user satisfac
 tion by ensuring that the core question or task is fully understood befor
 e the model attempts to provide a solution.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Anastasia Podrabinek\n\nWhat if you have a few hundre
 ds developers building their AI-based features all across a huge user-fac
 ing product? Sounds exciting but also a bit troubling: how is it possible
  to move fast without compromising security and quality standards of an e
 nterprise?\n\nDuring the past year\, we’ve built a whole infrastructure f
 or LLM-oriented development in Wix. As the industry was exploding with ne
 w models and techniques\, this infrastructure grew to include a wide rang
 e of tools to make developer experience with AI really smooth. But then w
 e’ve noticed something else: the easier it was to work with LLMs\, the mo
 re difficult it was to make sure that the quality of LLM-based features s
 tays high. That was the moment when we had to make a leap from AI democra
 tisation to AI standardisation.\n\nBuilding a whole infrastructure of pro
 mpt QA tools and arranging prompt engineering flows gave me some new insi
 ghts about bringing AI to enterprise while ensuring a high standard of LL
 M feature implementation.\n\nIn this talk\, I’ll take you through the AI 
 Standartisation journey we took and share some practical ideas of improvi
 ng prompt engineering standards across a big organisation. We’ll touch bo
 th technical solutions and educational approaches that can help in bringi
 ng enterprise prompt engineering standards to a higher level.\n

DESCRIPTION:Speakers: Alara Ozturk\, Hilik Paz\n\nAs Large Language Models
  (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into various applications\, the th
 reat of prompt injection attacks has emerged as a significant security co
 ncern. This presentation introduces a novel model-based input validation 
 approach to mitigate these attacks in LLM-integrated applications.\n\nWe 
 present a meta-prompt methodology that acts as an intermediate validator\
 , examining user inputs before they reach the LLM. Our approach builds on
  established input validation techniques\, drawing parallels with traditi
 onal security measures like SQL injection prevention.\n\nThroughout the p
 resentation\, we will discuss the challenges of input validation in LLM c
 ontexts and explore how our model-based approach provides a more flexible
  and adaptive solution. We'll share preliminary results from evaluations 
 against established prompt injection datasets\, highlighting the effectiv
 eness of our methodology in detecting and mitigating various types of inj
 ection attempts.\n\nJoin us for an insightful exploration of this innovat
 ive approach to enhancing the security of LLM applications through advanc
 ed prompt engineering techniques\, and learn how to implement robust inpu
 t validation mechanisms to safeguard your AI-driven systems.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Jeroen Egelmeers\n\nWith a "Co-pilot for everything\,
 " our interaction with technology and daily tasks is evolving. Organizati
 ons are increasingly integrating LLMs into their applications\, enhancing
  features like search tools\, chatbots\, and internal information systems
 .\n\nChances are\, you're already working with Generative AI or will be s
 oon. But are you aware of the risks before diving into use cases or devel
 opment? Curiosity drives us to explore limits\, which can lead to finding
  ways around "Guard Rails." These guard rails prevent misuse\, like askin
 g ChatGPT how to build a bomb. But what if clever wordplay confuses LLMs 
 into bypassing these safeguards?\n\nIn "The dark arts of Prompt Engineeri
 ng\," we'll explore Prompt Injections. We'll cover what Guard Rails are\,
  how they function\, and how to circumvent them using Prompt Injections—p
 urely for educational purposes. Understanding these risks is crucial for 
 knowing where to implement safeguards or reconsider actions. This session
  goes beyond tech details. It’s about real-life impacts. You'll see examp
 les that will make you rethink AI's role in our lives. We'll also discuss
  the ethical aspect—how to use AI responsibly and safely. Plus\, learn a 
 fun trick: hide some "words as weapons" in your CV to trick recruiters!\n
 \nAs AI is here to stay\, let's get secure and join this session!\nLearn 
 from the mistakes other companies have already made.\nDon’t miss this imp
 ortant and eye-opening session!
