      "description": "Imagine handing over your vacation planning to an AI. Sounds crazy, right? That's exactly what Jorrik did for his trip to Porto in Portugal. ChatGPT picked everything from restaurants to the sightseeing spots. But this trip taught Jorrik more than just how to order pastel de nata in Portuguese.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, you'll dive into different parallels between prompting engineering AI for travel tips and using it for coding and problem-solving. You'll learn why context is king in AI interactions and ways to provide it effectively. Jorrik will walk you through real examples from my AI-planned adventure, showing how each interaction unlocked new insights into advanced prompting techniques. Plus, he will introduce you to \"Indirect Conversation\" a new method he describes as \"pushing AI's creative boundaries\".\r\n\r\nIntegrating AI in applications is now everywhere to be found. And creating web applications, prompt engineering is set to become a crucial skill in our developers toolkit. The techniques you'll learn aren't just for planning vacations. They're the building blocks for creating smarter, more intuitive AI-powered tools. Whether you're designing chatbots, implementing AI-assisted search, or build the next-gen AI-driven web app, mastering these prompting skills will give you a significant benefit in creating a seamless user experience.\r\n\r\nBy the end of this session, you'll walk away with practical skills to supercharge your AI interactions, whether you're planning your next vacation or tackling complex coding challenges. You'll gain a fresh perspective on AI's capabilities and limitations, and you'll be equipped with strategies to get more innovative, useful responses from AI tools. Get ready for a session that's a bit of fun, part travelogue, mainly tech talk, and entirely eye-opening!",

      "description": "We showcase the importance of good query contextualization in document retrieval Q&A scenarios with various industry examples. We present approaches to improve contextualization by prompt engineering with TextGrad and show how crucial these improvements are for delivering industry-grade chatbot solutions and customer satisfaction.\r\n\r\nBackground: When performing document retrieval in a Q&A/chatbot scenario, just using the last Q&A message, namely the current human inquiry, as a target might not yield good results. Often the context needed for retrieving relevant documents is spread out over several previous messages. Query contextualization helps by transforming a message history into a singular retrieval query including the relevant context. Main threats to the quality of the retrieval are missing context, a direct answer to the question, and follow-up questions back to the user in the contextualized query. These threats can be contained by a good choice of the contextualization model and a well-designed system prompt.",

      "description": "The concept of optimizing prompt engineering through a multi-agent model involves dividing the task of understanding and refining user inputs into distinct roles. When a user provides an incomplete or unclear prompt, the first agent acts as an interactive mediator, engaging in a dialogue to elicit further details or clarify the intent behind the prompt. By refining and enhancing the initial query through iterative questioning or contextualization, the first agent ensures that the final prompt accurately represents the user's true needs. Once the prompt has been clarified, it is passed to the second agent, which is responsible for processing the refined input and generating the desired output. This system allows for more effective handling of vague or ambiguous prompts, improving overall response quality and user satisfaction by ensuring that the core question or task is fully understood before the model attempts to provide a solution.",

Sounds exciting but also a bit troubling: how is it possible to move fast without compromising security and quality standards of an enterprise?\r\n\r\nDuring the past year, we’ve built a whole infrastructure for LLM-oriented development in Wix. As the industry was exploding with new models and techniques, this infrastructure grew to include a wide range of tools to make developer experience with AI really smooth. But then we’ve noticed something else: the easier it was to work with LLMs, the more difficult it was to make sure that the quality of LLM-based features stays high. That was the moment when we had to make a leap from AI democratisation to AI standardisation.\r\n\r\nBuilding a whole infrastructure of prompt QA tools and arranging prompt engineering flows gave me some new insights about bringing AI to enterprise while ensuring a high standard of LLM feature implementation.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, I’ll take you through the AI Standartisation journey we took and share some practical ideas of improving prompt engineering standards across a big organisation. We’ll touch both technical solutions and educational approaches that can help in bringing enterprise prompt engineering standards to a higher level.\r\n",
